This project tracks the number of people in space in real time. It displays information on each person in space, including a short bio, a photo, and which ship they are currently aboard. The program makes use of a third-party API to pull data on the astronauts, uses the JSON data from the API and cross-references it with Wikipedia to render that data to the user, and makes use of JavaScripts fetch() method and promises to return and render the data.

Note that the API is only served via HTTP. As such, the site cannot be displayed live.
