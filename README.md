This project tracks the number of people in space in real time. It displays information on each person in space, including a short bio, a photo, and which ship they are currently aboard. The program makes use of Wikipedia's API to pull data on the astronauts, uses JSON to render that data to the user, and makes use of JavaScripts fetch() method and promises to return and render the data.
